# Audtool-cli
Audtool-cli is an "audacious clone" ported to the terminal, written in python. It aims to solve a problem I have when trying to change the song i'm listening to on my pc remotely (with my phone, another computer etc.). Until now I've been using KDE-Connect but it does not list all the songs I have saved, cannot change the playback type, and have other limitations, so that's why I'm making this.

It is being also a study of making more complex cli programs, more complex threading, cache and code optimization (since some commands are very costly).

In the future I might transform this cli into a web version that you can host on your local network and controll audacious in any browser, but that is a plan for the distant future.
